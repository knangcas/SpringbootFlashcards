# FlashCards-SPA
last updated: February 12th, 2025
## About

- THis is a web app version of [FlashCards](https://github.com/knangcas/FlashCards)
- Uses Java SpringBoot with embedded h2 database for backend (RESTful api. Will make api docs to accompany the api).
- Currently basic html/css/js for front end, mainly used just to get started.
- Makes use of Bootstrap framework.
- Future plans include use of MySQL (instead of h2), Docker to containerize, and use of React for frontend.

No screenshots as of yet, as it is very bare bones and is very much a work in progress.
