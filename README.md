# FlashCards-SPA
last updated: February 20th, 2025
## About

- THis is a web app version of [FlashCards](https://github.com/knangcas/FlashCards)
- Uses Java SpringBoot with embedded h2 database for backend (RESTful api. Will make api docs to accompany the api).
- Currently basic html/css/js for front end, mainly used just to get started.
- Makes use of Bootstrap framework.
- Future plans include use of MySQL (instead of h2), Docker to containerize, and use of React for frontend.
- VanillaJS implementation with bootstrap css. User can click on the flashcard to "flip" and see the answer. 
- Restart : returns to the initial state of the deck. 
- Next : Users click this when they know the answer. 
- Skip : Users click this when they want to skip the answer and come back to it later.
